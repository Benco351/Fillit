üß© Aggregation of Multiple Repositories This repository (Fillit) serves as an aggregation point for several codebases originally developed and maintained in separate repositories. 
The mvp_aggregation branch consolidates these components into a unified structure for easier development, deployment, and collaboration.

üîß Structure of the Aggregated Branch

Backend/

Contains the source code from the development branch of the Fillit_Backend repository. 
Here is the link to the actual Backend repository:

https://github.com/Benco351/Fillit_Backend

Frontend/

Contains the source code from the front_recent branch of the Fillit_Frontend repository.
Here is the link to the actual Frontend repository:

Architecutre/
Contains the source code from the _______

AI_lambda/

Contains the source code AWS lambda that used as AI chat

Note: The .git folders from the original repositories were removed during the migration to avoid embedding separate Git repositories within this one.

üì¶ How the Aggregation Was Performed:

Worktrees were used to temporarily check out the relevant branches from the source repositories without cloning them fully.

The contents of those branches were copied into the corresponding folders (Backend/, Frontend/) in this repository.

All .git metadata from the source repositories was excluded to maintain a clean monorepo structure.

Changes were committed and pushed into the mvp_aggregation branch of this repository.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:
This method does not preserve Git history from the original repositories.
